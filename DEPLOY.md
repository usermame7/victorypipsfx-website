# VictoryPipsFX Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚨 Important: This is a Static Site Only

This VictoryPipsFX project should be deployed as a **static frontend only** on Vercel. The backend server components are not needed for this deployment.

## ✅ Vercel Deployment Steps

### 1. Project Settings in Vercel
- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Build Command**: `vite build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 2. Environment Variables (if needed)
No environment variables are required for the static frontend deployment.

### 3. Build Configuration
The project includes:
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- `build.sh` - Custom build script
- Static site routing for SPA

### 4. What Gets Deployed
- ✅ React frontend with all components
- ✅ VictoryPipsFX branding and animations
- ✅ Google Ads compliant content
- ✅ Responsive design and interactions
- ❌ Backend server (not needed for static site)
- ❌ Database connections (not needed for static site)

### 🎯 Expected Result
Your deployed site should show:
- VictoryPipsFX logo and branding
- Gold chart background with candlesticks
- Hero section with animated statistics
- Member testimonials section
- Telegram integration buttons
- Professional dark theme
- All scroll animations and interactions

### 🔧 If Deployment Fails
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure build command is set to `vite build`
3. Verify output directory is `dist/public`
4. Make sure all dependencies are in package.json

The site should work perfectly as a static educational trading platform with all the Google Ads compliance features intact.
