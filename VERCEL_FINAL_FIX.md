# 🚨 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FINAL FIX

## Current Status
You have these static files ready in the root directory:
- `index.html` (main page)
- `assets/` folder (CSS, JS, images)
- `vercel.json` (minimal config)

## ✅ Immediate Fix for Vercel

### Step 1: Push These Files to GitHub
Make sure these files are committed and pushed:
- `index.html` (cleaned version)
- `assets/` directory
- `vercel.json` (simplified)

### Step 2: Vercel Project Settings
In your Vercel dashboard:

1. **Delete the current deployment**
2. **Import project again from GitHub**
3. **Set these exact settings:**
   - Framework Preset: **None**
   - Build Command: **Leave empty**
   - Output Directory: **Leave empty**
   - Install Command: **Leave empty**
   - Root Directory: **Leave empty**

### Step 3: Environment Variables
- Don't add any environment variables
- This is a pure static site

## 🎯 Expected Result
Your site will show:
- VictoryPipsFX logo and branding
- Dark theme with gold chart background
- Hero section with statistics
- Member testimonials section
- Telegram buttons
- All Google Ads compliant content

## 🔧 If Still Not Working
1. Check the "Functions" tab in Vercel - it should be empty
2. Check "Deployments" - you should see static files being served
3. Open browser dev tools on your site and check console for errors

## 📁 Files Structure

This is now a pure static website with no backend dependencies.
