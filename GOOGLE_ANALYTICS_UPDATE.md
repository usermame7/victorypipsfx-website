# üîç Google Analytics Integration - VictoryPipsFX

## ‚úÖ Successfully Added Google Analytics Tracking

I've integrated the Google Analytics (gtag.js) code into your VictoryPipsFX website exactly as shown in your screenshot.

### Added Code:
```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-17481614440"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'AW-17481614440');
</script>
```

### Integration Details:
- **Location**: Added to `<head>` section before other meta tags (Google's recommendation)
- **Tracking ID**: AW-17481614440 (your Google Ads conversion tracking)
- **Implementation**: Standard gtag.js setup for conversion tracking
- **Clean Build**: Removed development scripts for production
