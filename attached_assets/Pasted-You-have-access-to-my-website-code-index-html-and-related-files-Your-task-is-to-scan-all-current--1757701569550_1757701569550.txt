You have access to my website code (index.html and related files). Your task is to scan all current text on the site and rewrite it so that it is compliant with Google Ads financial policies. The website should look professional, educational, and trust-building while avoiding risky words.

1. Search the entire website (index.html and subpages) for risky words or claims like:

guarantee, guaranteed, 100%, never lose, risk-free, secret, get rich, profit daily, make $, earn $, double your, accuracy %, win rate, autopilot, financial freedom fast, zero losses.

Any numeric claims of profit or win rate (e.g., “97% accurate signals”).

Any text that says “make money,” “profits,” or “earn daily.”

Sensational hooks like “WARNING,” “BREAKING,” “SECRET STRATEGY.”

2. Replace them with safe, compliant alternatives:

“Forex signals” → “Forex & Gold market insights” or “trade ideas.”

“Proven strategies” → “educational strategies” or “market analysis.”

“Make money / earn profits” → “stay informed / make better decisions.”

“97% accuracy” → “daily updates and clear trade levels.”

“Secret / guaranteed” → “transparent methodology / no guarantees.”

3. Insert the following safe text structure into the website:
