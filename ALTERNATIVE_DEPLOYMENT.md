# ðŸš€ ALTERNATIVE DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

Since Vercel is giving us issues, here are 3 guaranteed working alternatives:

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)
âœ… **Free and reliable**
âœ… **Automatic deployment from GitHub**
âœ… **Perfect for static sites**

### Steps:
1. Push all files to GitHub repository
2. Go to your GitHub repo â†’ Settings â†’ Pages
3. Source: "GitHub Actions"
4. The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically deploy
5. Your site will be at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

## Option 2: Netlify
âœ… **Drag and drop deployment**
âœ… **Works immediately**

### Steps:
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop these files:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder
   - `netlify.toml`
3. Site deploys instantly

## Option 3: Surge.sh (Super Simple)
âœ… **Command line deployment**
âœ… **Works in 30 seconds**

### Steps:
```bash
npm install -g surge
cd /path/to/your/files
surge
```
Follow prompts and your site is live!

## Current Files Ready:
- `index.html` (clean, no backend dependencies)
- `assets/` (all CSS, JS, images)
- `netlify.toml` (Netlify config)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (GitHub Pages auto-deploy)

## Recommendation:
Try **GitHub Pages** first - it's free, reliable, and automatically deploys when you push to GitHub. The workflow file I created will handle everything automatically.

All options will serve your VictoryPipsFX website perfectly with the dark theme, animations, and Google Ads compliance.
